# AMS161XMANIM

## Welcome
Hi, welcome to AMS161 X MANIM. Manim is one of the most beautiful animating softwares I have ever seen, and it is all thanks to the community, and 3b1b for making it possible. I have recently been inspired to go and try to make my own animation, I am accepting pull requests if anyone wants to help improve my code. However, be warned. A lot of my code was written at around 3 in the morning where I should be sleeping, so it's not the greatest. Plus, I was learning the library right while doing it...

My goal is to make a __simple-to-understand__ animation that can hopefully explain the concepts of AMS161 in just under 10 minutes (Yes I know at one point in the commits it says 5 minutes, I severely underestimated the complexity required.)

## Constraints
I had only a weeks notice to do it, as I saw a tiny gap in my schedule and decided to cram as many chapters and information into the animation as possible. The result? A disaster. I got sick a couple of times, and I had to halt the project even more. I unfortunately probably won't be able to finish by Thursday (at time of writing, I am studying for my AMS final which is on Decemter 8th 2022. This is my study "sheet").

## I want to help!
Great! Please let me know if you are interested, and we can talk.
